# 42 Python Data Science Piscine

Welcome to my repository for the **Python Data Science Piscine** at [42](https://42.fr). This intense 5-day bootcamp focuses on mastering Python through hands-on projects in data analysis, image processing, object-oriented programming, and more.

## 📚 Contents

### 🧠 Day 0 – Python Basics
Basic Python syntax, data structures, script handling, and reimplementing core functions.

- `ex00`: Hello script
- `ex01`: Format date/time output
- `ex02`: Type detector function
- `ex03`: NULL type handler
- `ex04`: Even or Odd checker
- `ex05`: String character analysis
- `ex06`: Reimplement `filter` + filter words by length
- `ex07`: Encode text in Morse code
- `ex08`: Custom tqdm progress bar using `yield`
- `ex09`: Create and install a Python package

---

### 📸 Day 1 – Arrays & Image Manipulation
Using NumPy and image libraries to work with arrays, transformations, and color filters.

- `ex00`: Compute BMI and apply limits
- `ex01`: 2D slicing of nested lists
- `ex02`: Load image and display RGB array
- `ex03`: Zoom on image and reshape
- `ex04`: Rotate image using transpose
- `ex05`: Apply color filters (invert, red, green, blue, grey)

---

### 📊 Day 2 – Working with DataTables
Explore real-world datasets with Pandas and visualize them using Matplotlib/Seaborn.

- `ex00`: Load CSV and display dimensions
- `ex01`: Display life expectancy for a country
- `ex02`: Compare population between countries (1800–2050)
- `ex03`: Scatterplot of GDP vs life expectancy in 1900

---

### 🧱 Day 3 – Oriented Object Programming
Dive into class design, inheritance, decorators, and vector math with OOP.

- `ex00`: Abstract `Character` class + `Stark` subclass
- `ex01`: `Baratheon` & `Lannister` classes + factory method
- `ex02`: Diamond inheritance in `King` class
- `ex03`: `calculator` class (scalar operations)
- `ex04`: Vector ops (dot product, add, sub) via decorators

---

### 🧬 Day 4 – Data-Oriented Design
Higher-order functions, statistical operations, decorators, and dataclasses.

- `ex00`: `ft_statistics()` with dynamic kwargs (mean, std, etc.)
- `ex01`: Closure with function chaining (outer/inner)
- `ex02`: Function call limiter (decorator)
- `ex03`: `Student` dataclass with login and random ID

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.10
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- PIL / OpenCV (image manipulation)
